# Fiendish Minimal
![Fiendish Minimal Preview](/v2Preview_title_large.jpg)

Fiendish Minimal was designed out of my need for a multi-column, responsive, minimal theme for my car blog.

It's not much, but I've put a lot of love into it.

## Features

>Responsive design that degrades from three columns into two and finally a single column for mobile browsers (Looks nice however large your screen is)
> 
>Sticky header (It's sticky!)
>
>Infinite scroll and cute custom loading gif (Pages are for geeks)
>
>Reasonable customisation pre-filled with global appearance settings (Make it look the way you want - just don't make my theme look bad *single tear*)
>
>Readable code and a Creative Commons license for the tinkerers (Like me)
>
>Expand posts by tagging with x3 or x2 to triple or double their width on grid pages (Highlight important posts)
>
>Unleash the 90s with options to colour up your posts according to the tags - set the tag you want in the theme options, and then simply apply the tag when you create the post. Pink, Blue, Green and Yellow (#ff3399, #3399ff, #33ff99 and #ffe199)

This isn't a paid theme or a team effort, so it's pretty simple, but at least you can find the customisation settings you want easily, and hopefully at ~52kB for my components, it will load up pretty quickly.

Enjoy!
